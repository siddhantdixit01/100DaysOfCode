<h1>Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>
<p>Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order. 
It is called bubble sort because the movement of array elements is just like the movement of air bubbles in the water. 
Bubbles in water rise up to the surface; similarly, the array elements in bubble sort move to the end in each iteration.

<p>Follow the below steps to solve the problem:
<ul><li>Run a nested for loop to traverse the input array using two variables i and j, such that 0 ≤ i < n-1 and 0 ≤ j < n-i-1</li>
<li>If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1] then swap these adjacent elements, else move on</li>
<li>Print the sorted array</li></ul></p>
