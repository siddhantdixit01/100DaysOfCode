<h1>Circular Linked List</h1>
Circular Linked List is a type of linked list that is circular in nature. In a circular linked list, every node has successor. In this data structure, every node points to the next node and the last node of the linked list points to the first node. This feature makes it circular in nature. It is essential to know that the circular linked lists have no end and we need to be careful while traversing the linked list. 
<h3>Application of Circular Linked Lists:</h3>
<ul><li>
  Circular Linked Lists can be used to manage the computing resources of the computer.</li><li>
Data structures such as stacks and queues are implemented with the help of the circular linked lists.</li><li>
Circular Linked List is also used in the implementation of advanced data structures such as a Fibonacci Heap.</li><li>
  It is also used in computer networking for token scheduling.</li></ul>
