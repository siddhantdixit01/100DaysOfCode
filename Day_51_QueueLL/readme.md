<h1>Queue using Linked List</h1>

In a Queue data structure, we maintain two pointers, front, and rear. The front points to the first item of the queue and rear points to the last item.

<b>enQueue()--</b> This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the next node.
<b>deQueue()--</b> This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next node.
